This is the client side of my team's capstone project and my first full stack project with complete branding.
I was honored to be the Scrum Master on this project.
Though it was originally built as a team project for a software development boot camp,
this version will update periodically to include my personal enhancements and refactoring.

"The Pantry Door" helps users find food pantries in their area by address or zipcode search.
It currently only has a handful of listings and limited dashboard features, 
but this app is scalable and I have high goals for extension and possible publishing.

Please use the git command, npm run dev, in your terminal,
and http://localhost:4001 in your browswer, to view the app live.
