This is my team's capstone project and my first full stack project with complete branding.
I was honored to be the Scrum Master on this project.
Though it was originally built as a team project for a software development boot camp,
this version includes my personal enhancements and refactoring.

"The Pantry Door" helps users find food pantries in their area by address or zipcode search.
It currently only has a handful of listings and limited dashboard features, 
but I have high goals and plans for extension and possible publishing.
