                - Do NOT include 'password' as a TextInput directly as it will show hashes.
                - Use a <PasswordInput source="password" label="New Password (optional)" />
                  and ensure your backend only updates the password if this field is provided and hashed.
                  You would typically not display the existing hashed password.
